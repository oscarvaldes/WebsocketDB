<p>To whom it may concern:</p>

<p>After reading the GitHub repo, I hope most of the functionality and application structure makes sense. The goal of this application is to mimic the current functionality of the AG-database (ask Rick to show you if you have not seen it); however, the main difference between this application and the current DB is that this application works with a MySQL database. There are many advantages to a MySQL DB over a traditional Access DB (<i>worth researching</i>). </p>

<p><b>Getting Started:</b></p>

<p>Your four most used commands from the server terminal will be (<b>make sure you are in the project directory when running these commands</b>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>pm2 status //will give you valuable information about the application ex: if it’s running or if it’s down; sometimes the app may stop running if Rick has done a server restart</p>

  <li>pm2 start processes.json –env production //to start the application if it is not already running</p>

  <li>pm2 stop processes.json //stops the application</p>

  <li>pm2 logs //probably my most used command because it allows you to print stuff to the console server-side and debug</p>
</ul>
<p><b>Passwords:</b></p>

<p>For admin functionality: soiltest</p>

<p>MySQL DB: (same as desktop log in)</p>

<p><b>Important Notes:</b></p>

<p>The MySQL DB and the node application are running on the server. However, you can access the MySQL DB using the workbench app on this computer. You can also code normally on this computer, but when changes are made to the back-end (node) you must restart the application from the server terminal, so that the changes are reflected correctly.</p>

<p><b>To-do List:</b></p>

<p>On the GitHub repository, I included a to-do list of things I haven’t gotten to. You are welcome to use this list as a guide, but you are free to add any features/functionality you see fit.</p>

<p><b>GitHub:</b></p>

<p><i>If you are comfortable using GitHub</i>, I have installed Git on this computer, so that you can create a branch, then pull-request whenever you finish something, and I’ll be able to see that and update the repository with your changes. If you don’t use GitHub, it’s no big deal, I’ll see all your work when I get back in the Fall!</p>

<p><b>Contact:</b></p>

<p>If you have any questions, I will be on my computer 24/7 this summer, so please do not hesitate to contact me! You can email me at <a href="mailto:oscarito@uga.edu">oscarito@uga.edu</a></p>

<p>Hope you have a great summer at the lab!</p>
